    The project is exiting !
    I definitely can't help it, I'm gonna make it a bit more complex.

    Alright, architecture is a bit more difficult than I thought. I still want to keep this up, it's a challenge but it's a way to push my ability to do it a quite further. I will succeed, and if it gets too short, I'll give the strict work asked for this mission.

    Here is the render.
    I'm proud and not proud.

    I've been encountering problems mostly with logical point of views. I might have been focusing on the exact task to do, but I'm a studdent right now, so I got to do the most ambitious things to be ready. As we say, who can more can less, I learnt a lot of things especially on abstraction. I learnt fiew things on POO JS too.
    I hope my work won't be too complicated to read.
